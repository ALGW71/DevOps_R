>>>> TEAM OF DEVELOPERS (ALEX & MARTIN & JAMES)

>>>> WORKING ON CODE

>>>> KEPT IN A REPOSITORY IN GITHUB

>>>> CUSTOMERS USE THE CODE TO ANALYSE DATA

>>>> UPDATES TO THE CODE MUST BE TESTED BEFORE GOING ONTO THE CLIENT SYSTEMS

>>> IMPORT TO:
		1. KEEP THE CODE RUNNING.

		2. MAKES SURE RESULT ARE ACCURATE.

		3. NOT CRASH THE CUSTOMER SYSTEMS











########## PROBLEMS ########## 

1. DID WE RUN ALL THE TESTS ON THE CODE (20 test scripts)?

	Did all the tests pass?


2. ARE ALL OUR SYSTEMS THE SAME (OPERATING SYSTEMS, UPDATES, CODE, ENVIRONMENT)

	Are they the same as our client systems?

3. DETAILS OF ALL THE TEST AND CHANGES TO THE TEST CODE NOT CONTROLLED...

	How do you know you ran the same tests as last time?
		Did someone change my test script?
			










########## DREAM ########## 

> REMOVE HUMAN ERROR

> VIEW & CONTROL THE STEPS

> CONTROLLED ENVIROMENT

> SEE ALL STEPS AND CHANGES












########## SOLUTION ########## 

> AUTOMATION - Jenkins, TravisCI, GitHub-Actions, GitLab-Runner.


> INFRASTRUCTURE (PIPELINES,TEST-SCRIPTS)... AS CODE (SOURCE CONTROL MANAGEMENT)

>>>>>>>>> "See the testing steps"

		YAML, DOCKERFILE, JENKINSFILE

>>>>>>>>> "Highlight changes to the testing steps"  

		Git

>>>>>>>>> "Control all environments and tests in one place."
